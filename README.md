# Machine Learning - Coursera Stanford University

Repository for the programming exercises of the Machine Learning course in Coursera from Andrew Ng (Stanford University)
This is suppose to help you compare your answers and not use it as your own solutions. The course is found in https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.
Notice that a template is given by the course.

## Getting Started

For this project, you will only require to have Matlab or Octave(>=3.8.0). These solutions have been written in MatlabR2018b and have not being tested in Octave.

## Content of the Programming Assignments

* Exercise 1 - Linear Regression
* Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression
* Exercise 3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
* Exercise 4 - Neural Network Learning
* Exercise 5 - Machine Learning System Design
* Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Exercise 7 - K-Means Clustering and PCA
* Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
